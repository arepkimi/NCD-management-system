                    <h3>High Blood Pressure</h3>
                    <p>
                        Blood Pressure is the force of blood exerted on your artery walls. 
                        It's measured as two numbers which is Systolic - (Pressure During Heart Contraction) 
                        and Diastolic - (Pressure Between Heartbeats). A normal reading is around 120/80 mmHg. 
                        High blood pressure can damage your health. Regular checks are crucial for early detection and management.

                    <h3>Diabetes</h3>
                    <p>
                        Diabetes is a disease that affects how your body turns food into energy. 
                        Normally, your body uses insulin to turn food into sugar (glucose) for energy. 
                        In people with diabetes, their body either doesn't produce enough insulin or can't use it properly. 
                        This causes blood sugar levels to rise, leading to serious health problems if not managed.

                    <h3>Heart Disease</h3>
                    <p>
                        Heart disease is a condition that affects your heart's health. 
                        It can involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels, irregular heartbeats, or heart muscle damage. 
                        Common types include coronary artery disease, heart attack, and heart failure. 
                        These conditions can limit your heart's ability to pump blood effectively, leading to various health issues.
